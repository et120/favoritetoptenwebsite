Comment(s): The website is very well designed and looks super nice. It runs well and has a nice mix of fonts. The site is resposive and I like how it swaps to an accordian once you get to Ipad size and is really solid, I like what you guys did with the main menu, like the last updated, the carousel and the part that asks if you want to see team Bronel or team Elizabeth. Great Job, looks awesome!
